In this tutorial, we will be exploring different ways of rendering a list of
items in Lit!

Let's begin by looking a how we might render a list of names from an array.
We've already set up a custom element with a `names` property that is an
array of strings.

We can utlize the `map` array prototype method to generate a list item
for each item in the array within the unordered list (`<ul></ul>`).

```ts
${this.names.map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
```
