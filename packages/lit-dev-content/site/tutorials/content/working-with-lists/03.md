The rendering methods we've seen so far make it so that Lit keeps track of the
DOM elements and will update them accordingly when the property items change.
This is usually fine and efficient but sometimes we may want to control how
the each item is tied to the DOM element so that we'd rather have the DOM
element move rather than updating.

For instance, take a look at the example component we have here where each
todo item is rendered as a list item with a checkbox. We also have buttons
to sort these items in ascending and descending alphabetical order. Try
checking one of the items and changing the sort order. You'll notice that
the item text changes but not the position of the checked box. This is
because Lit is updating the text rather than moving the entire DOM node.

This is where the [`repeat`](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/directives/#repeat)
directive comes in. We can replace the expression that's currently using
the `map` method to utilize `repeat` like this.
```ts
import {repeat} from 'lit/directives/repeat.js';
```
```ts
${repeat(
  this.items,
  (item) => item.id,
  (item) => html`<li><label><input type="checkbox">${item.task}</label></li>`
)}
```
