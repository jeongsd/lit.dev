We've see how we can use a `for ... of` loop to populate an array of templates
to render. However, Lit also provides a built-in
[`map`](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/directives/#map) directive for a
more declarative way of writing templates.

The previous example can be solved by first importing the `map` directive
```ts
import {map} from 'lit/directives/map.js';
```

then placing the expression below in the template returned by the render method.
```ts
${map(this.items, (item) => html`<li>${item}</li>`)}
```
