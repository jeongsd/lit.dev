In `index.html`, `<my-element>`'s `date` property is still being set with Javascript. Requiring Javascript to set a property is not ideal for users of a `<my-element>` because setting properties this way is not as readable or easy as setting attributes.

## Goal for this step

Accept `date-str` as an attribute in HTML, synchronize the `date` property with `dateStr` property whenever `dateStr` changes, and display the user-defined date in a readable manner using `toLocaleDateString`.

### Accept `date-str` as an attribute

* Stop passing the `Date` to `date` property of `my-element`
* Pass `05/05/22` to the `date-str` attribute of `my-element`

#### index.html

```html
<body>
  <my-element date-str="05/05/22"></my-element>
</body>
```

Now you may notice that the date displayed is not the same as the one you passed in. This is because the `date` property is being rendered. `date` needs to be synchonized with `dateStr` whenever `dateStr` changes.

### Update `date` when `dateStr` changes

* On each change convert the `dateStr` to a JS `Date` object
* Update the `date` property to reflect the user-defined date so that it can be displayed

The `willUpdate` method is a good place to reconcile two different reactive properties. Read more on the Lit lifecycle [here](/docs/components/lifecycle/)!

#### my-element.(ts|js)

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
export class MyElement extends LitElement {
  ...

  willUpdate(changed: PropertyValues<this>) {
    if (changed.has('dateStr') && this.dateStr) {
      this.date = new Date(this.dateStr);
    }
  }

  ...
```

```js
export class MyElement extends LitElement {
  ...

  willUpdate(changed) {
    if (changed.has('dateStr') && this.dateStr) {
      this.date = new Date(this.dateStr);
    }
  }

  ...
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Now the correct date should be displayed when the `date-str` attribute changes!
