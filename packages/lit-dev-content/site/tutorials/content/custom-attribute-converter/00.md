Web Components can receive data in many ways, but one of the most commmon ways is to use an attribute because they are declarative, static, and easy to write and read.

Lit will automatically convert any given attributes into properties, but some properties will not map easily to an attribute making it difficult to write the attribute.

## What you'll learn

- What is an attribute converter
- How Lit's built-in attribute converters work
- How to write your own attribute converter

## What you'll build

In this tutorial you will build a component that takes in a human-readable date-string, converts to a Javascript Date object, and displays the given date in a human readable manner.

You will do this with the default attribute converters and then upgrade your component with your own custom attribute converter that can convert a date-string attribute into a Javascript Date object property and vice versa.

## Previous knowledge

It's recommended you understand the basics of [reactive properties](/docs/components/properties/) in Lit.
