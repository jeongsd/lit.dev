## Web Components

Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets built on the Web Component standards will work across modern browsers and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.

## Lit
