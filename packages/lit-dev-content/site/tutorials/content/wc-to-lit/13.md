## Congratulations!

You've built a "vanilla" Web Component and converted it to a Lit-based Web Component!

We've been able to convert an unreadable 93-line vanilla web component with a 43-line html template to a 68-line Lit-based Web Component template-and-all! (JS: 104 + 43 lines to 75 lines)

## What's Does lit-html Do again?

`lit-html`, Lit's rendering system does the following:

* Efficiently renders and updates DOM
* Enables you to easily package your template with your component
* Allows you to write templates without the need for a compiler
* Enables you to write readable, declarative templates and code with special binding syntax
* And much more!

## What does LitElement do again?

`LitElement`, Lit's Web Component base class does the following:

* Handles converting attributes to properties
* Handles reflecting properties back into attributes
* Provides a render and re-render reactive lifecycle
* Handles your re-renders efficiently and asynchronously
* And does all of this without a build and only ~5kb lines of code!

`LitElement` also enables many more advanced features as the Lit team & community has been building an ecosystem of tooling around it. Learn more by reading the [Lit Documentation](https://lit.dev/docs/)!
