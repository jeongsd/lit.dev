## Why Shadow DOM?

In the previous step, you'll notice that the selectors in the `<style>` tag that you inserted select any `<rating-element>` on the page as well as any `<button>`. This may result in the styles leaking out of the element and selecting other nodes that you may not intend to style. Additionally, other styles outside of this custom element may unintentionally style the nodes inside your custom element.

For example, try putting a style tag in the head of the main document:

### index.html

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <script src="./rating-element.js" type="module"></script>
   <style>
     span {
       border: 1px solid red;
     }
   </style>
 </head>
 <body>
   <rating-element></rating-element>
 </body>
</html>
```

Your output should have a red border box around the span for the rating. This is a trivial case, but the lack of DOM encapsulation may result in larger problems for more complex applications. This is where shadow DOM comes in.

## Attaching a Shadow Root

Inside the `connectedCallback`, attach a shadow root to the element and render the DOM inside of that root:

### rating-element.<litdev-code-language-display></litdev-code-language-display>

```js
connectedCallback() {
  const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});

  // Note the new CSS Selectors
  shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
    <style>
      :host {
        display: inline-flex;
        align-items: center;
      }
      button {
        background: transparent;
        border: none;
        cursor: pointer;
      }
    </style>
    <button class="thumb_down" >
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M15 3H6c-.83 0-1.54.5-1.84 1.22l-3.02 7.05c-.09.23-.14.47-.14.73v2c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h6.31l-.95 4.57-.03.32c0 .41.17.79.44 1.06L9.83 23l6.59-6.59c.36-.36.58-.86.58-1.41V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zm4 0v12h4V3h-4z"/></svg>
    </button>
    <span class="rating">${this.rating}</span>
    <button class="thumb_up">
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24"><path d="M1 21h4V9H1v12zm22-11c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2h-6.31l.95-4.57.03-.32c0-.41-.17-.79-.44-1.06L14.17 1 7.59 7.59C7.22 7.95 7 8.45 7 9v10c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h9c.83 0 1.54-.5 1.84-1.22l3.02-7.05c.09-.23.14-.47.14-.73v-2z"/></svg>
    </button>
  `;
}
```

Now the red border box should be gone—the styles in the main document can no longer select the nodes inside the shadow root.

How did you do this? In the `connectedCallback` you called `this.attachShadow` which attaches a shadow root to an element. The `open` mode means that the shadow content is inspectable and makes the shadow root accessible via `this.shadowRoot` as well. Take a look at the web component in the Chrome inspector as well:

<img src="/images/tutorials/wc-to-lit/dom-tree.png" alt="The DOM tree in the chrome inspector. There is a <rating-element> with a #shadow-root (open) as it&rsquo;s child, and the DOM from before inside that shadow root.">

You should now see a shadow root inside your component. You can expand the shadow root to show the contents of the shadow DOM. If you select the rating element in Chrome Dev Tools and call `$0.children`, you'll notice that it returns no children. The shadow DOM is its own DOM tree, separate from the component's direct children.

## Light DOM

An experiment: add a node as a direct child of the `<rating-element>`:

### index.html

```html
<rating-element>
 <div>
   This is the light DOM!
 </div>
</rating-element>
```

Once the page refreshes, you'll see that the new `<div>` does not show up. This is because shadow DOM has features to control how child nodes—sometimes called *light DOM*—are rendered or *projected* into the shadow DOM.
